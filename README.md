# Spice

Spice is a unified music application repository containing:

- an Electron desktop client for YouTube Music, SoundCloud, and SPICE Music;
- the SPICE web and local runtime backend;
- an Android preview client.

The desktop app includes ad blocking, Discord Rich Presence, Last.fm and ListenBrainz scrobbling, synchronized lyrics, and classic wrapper and native SPICE modes.

## Repository layout

- The repository root contains the CommonJS Electron desktop app (`main.js`, `preload.js`, and the desktop HTML/CSS files).
- `apps/backend` contains the Next.js backend and the build scripts for local Windows and Linux runtimes.
- `apps/mobile` contains the native Android client and its npm command wrappers.
- `native-runtime` receives a prepared local runtime for native Electron builds. Its generated contents are not source files.
- `test` contains the desktop Node test suite.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 24 and npm.
- JDK 21 and Android SDK compile SDK 36 for Android work.
- Platform packaging tools required by Electron Builder when producing installers.

## Install

One root install covers both the desktop app and the backend workspace:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Anti-Depressants-Dev-Team/spice.git
cd spice
npm ci
```

Use `npm install` when intentionally changing dependencies and updating `package-lock.json`.

## Desktop commands

```bash
npm start                 # Standard Electron wrapper
npm run start:native      # SPICE-only desktop development mode
npm test                  # Desktop Node tests
npm run dist              # Standard desktop package
npm run dist:native       # Native package for the current platform
npm run dist:native:windows
npm run dist:native:linux
```

Native builds use distinct application metadata and update channels, so publishing a native build does not replace the classic desktop updater release.

## Backend commands

Run backend work through the root npm wrappers:

```bash
npm run backend:dev
npm run backend:test
npm run backend:typecheck
npm run backend:lint
npm run backend:build:local
npm run backend:build:vercel
npm run backend:package:local:windows
npm run backend:package:local:linux
```

The Vercel project root remains `apps/backend` inside this unified repository.

## Local runtime preparation

`npm run native:prepare-runtime` now builds and packages `apps/backend` from this repository by default, then copies the result into `native-runtime/spice-local-windows` or `native-runtime/spice-local-linux`. `dist:native:*` already invokes this preparation step; do not run it separately before a native distribution command.

For an intentional external backend checkout, set `SPICE_BACKEND_REPO` to that repository root. If no usable checkout is available, preparation can download the matching artifact from the dedicated [`spice-local-runtime`](https://github.com/Anti-Depressants-Dev-Team/spice/releases/tag/spice-local-runtime) release. `SPICE_NATIVE_RUNTIME_ZIP_URL` can override that artifact URL for testing.

The stable runtime release is separate from versioned desktop releases and is deliberately not marked as GitHub's latest release.

## Android commands

```bash
npm run mobile:test
npm run mobile:build
npm run mobile:android:debug
npm run mobile:android:check
npm run mobile:android:release
```

The debug APK is written under `apps/mobile/android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/`.

## Verification

Before submitting a change, run the checks for the areas you touched:

```bash
npm test
npm run backend:test
npm run backend:typecheck
npm run backend:lint
npm run backend:build:local
npm run backend:build:vercel
npm run mobile:android:check   # for mobile changes
```

For native runtime or packaging changes, also run `npm run start:native` or the relevant `npm run dist:native:*` command when practical.

## Migration note

The former separate SPICE backend repository has been merged into `apps/backend`. The root `package.json` and `package-lock.json` are now the single npm workspace authority for desktop and backend dependencies. A sibling backend checkout is no longer expected, and pnpm workspace files or separate backend lockfiles should not be reintroduced.

## Releases

Installers and APKs are available from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/Anti-Depressants-Dev-Team/spice/releases). AppImage builds use the in-app updater; `.deb` and `.rpm` installs are updated through the matching package format.
